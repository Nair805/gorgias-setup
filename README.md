# Gorgias Implementation

This repository contains documentation for setting up and configuring Gorgias, a customer service platform. The project showcases my ability to streamline customer support workflows through automation, tagging, and view creation, ensuring faster response times and improved team efficiency.

## Overview

I led the implementation and optimization of Gorgias to enhance customer support operations for a growing e-commerce company. My contributions included:
- Automating ticket workflows to reduce manual effort.
- Auto-tagging and categorization of tickets for better organization.
- Creating custom views for tracking shipping-related inquiries and quotes.
- Developing macros to improve response consistency and efficiency.

These improvements significantly reduced ticket backlog, improved resolution times, and enhanced team workflow visibility.

## Features Implemented

### Automated Rules
- Auto-tagged shipping inquiries by detecting keywords related to order tracking.
- Automatically closed tickets from no-reply emails or those containing specific phrases, reducing clutter.
- Auto-tagged purchase order (PO) emails as "Not Shipped" until fulfilled.
- Once resolved, tickets were tagged as "Shipped" and moved to the appropriate view.

### Custom Views
- Created a "Not Shipped" view to consolidate all open shipping-related inquiries.
- Built a "Shipped" view to track all completed and closed shipping inquiries.
- Built a "Quotes" view to track open quote inquiries.

### Team Efficiency Enhancements
- Developed macros for common customer inquiries such as:
  - "Where is my order?"
  - "What materials are your products made from?"
  - "How do your products work?"
  - "Do you provide testing results?"
- Implemented automated ticket assignments to ensure inquiries were routed to the correct team members.
- Created sorting rules to prioritize high-importance tickets.

## How It Works

### 1. Incoming Ticket Processing
- Emails with shipping-related keywords (e.g., “Where is my order?”) were automatically tagged as "Shipping Inquiry."
- Emails from no-reply addresses were automatically closed.
- Purchase order emails were tagged as "Not Shipped" for tracking.

### 2. Workflow Automation
- Once a ticket was resolved, it was tagged as "Shipped" and moved to the appropriate view.
- If an email was from a no-reply domain, it was automatically closed.

### 3. Custom Views for Better Organization
- "Not Shipped" View: Displays all unresolved shipping-related tickets.
- "Shipped" View: Displays all completed and closed shipping inquiries.
- "Quotes" View: Displays all open quote inquiries.

### 4. Macros and Pre-Written Responses
- Standardized responses to common questions such as:
  - "Where is my order?"
  - "What materials are your products made from?"
  - "How do your products work?"
  - "Do you provide testing results?"

## Expected Benefits

- Faster ticket resolution by automating repetitive workflows.
- Reduced ticket backlog by auto-closing unnecessary emails.
- Improved organization with dedicated views for "Not Shipped," "Shipped," and "Quotes."
- Increased accuracy in ticket categorization through automation.
- Enhanced customer satisfaction by providing quick, consistent responses.

## Lessons Learned

- Automation significantly improves efficiency by reducing manual ticket handling.
- Custom views help prioritize urgent tasks and provide better visibility into pending work.
- Training the team on new workflows ensures smooth adoption and optimal usage.
- Continuous monitoring and rule refinement enhance accuracy and workflow effectiveness.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced analytics to track customer inquiry trends and optimize workflows.
- Integrate with third-party tools like ShipStation to automate ticket creation for shipping updates.
- Expand macros for handling refunds, returns, and escalations.
- Further refine keyword-based auto-tagging for improved accuracy.

## Final Thoughts

This project highlights my ability to implement automation, optimize workflows, and improve customer support efficiency using Gorgias. These changes streamlined operations, reduced manual tasks, and improved overall response times.
